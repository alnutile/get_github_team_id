# Get Github Team ID from Team Name

For some reason this is not just on Github but.

## Install

`pip3 install pygithub`

Once that is in place you can run this script

`python3 git_team_id.py YOUR_TOKEN ORG_NAME "Team Name"`

The team name is not from the URL but has to be the team name, with spaces and caps if it is formatted that way.
